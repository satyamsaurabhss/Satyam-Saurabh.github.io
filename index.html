                    <strong>Composite Membrane for Environmental Applications</strong><br>
                    Advanced porous material has supremacy in terms of flexible framework, and structure-property correlations. Thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, structure, and geometry will be tuned accordingly, and synthesize of the composite material depending on various applications like gas separation and storage, catalysis, ion sieving, and device fabrication. Hybrid composite materials are represented something of ''holy grail'' and spurred a significant deal of attention due to the creation of unique and multifunctional platforms to achieve desired applications. In virtue of this, for the synthesis of 2D membrane, I have rationally chosen characteristics of MOF, COF, POP cage, polymer, fiber, can result in a unique hybrid composite that will have different functional groups, active site, robust in stability, and superior for environmental applications. I also focus on utilizing Machine Learning algorithms and packages to obtain desired structure-property correlation.

                    <strong>Covalent Organic Framewoks (COFs), Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Mxene and various composite for Li ion / Na ion battery</strong><br>
                    Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as two burgeoning families of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been extensively investigated and applied in various fields on account of their enticing features as large surface area, controllable crystalline structure and highly ordered pores/channels. Crystalline porous materials including MOFs and COFs have generated great interest in battery fields (Li/Na ion) because the ordered porous frameworks can offer a fast-ionic transportation and storage path without large volume variation. MOFs and COFs cab be utilized in three main parts of battery, including electrode materials or host materials, solid-state electrolyte and separator.

                    <strong>Porous Materials for contaminated water purification</strong><br>
                    The global crisis of insufficient availability of clean water that meets the stringent guidelines of different environmental regulatory agencies has risen remarkably. Since the advent of the industrial revolution, human activities have significantly accelerated water pollution that disturbs our Earth's ecosystem. According to the US-based Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), inorganic oxoanions are the primary source of water pollution, among various other pollutants. Most of these toxic water-polluting species mobilize in aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, oceans, groundwater, etc., making them challenging to filter out even by traditional, commercially available energy-efficient technologies. Unsafe drinking water jeopardises human health, leading to death in its most serious cases, and causes severe environmental contamination. Therefore, remediation of such a class of toxic elements from the contaminated water is paramount to re-establish the planet's ecological balance.

                    <strong>Cu MOFs derived composite for CO2 capture and reduction</strong><br>
                    Cu MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks) derived composites have emerged as promising materials for both CO2 capture and reduction processes. These innovative materials combine the high surface area and tunable pore structures of MOFs with the catalytic properties of copper to efficiently capture and convert carbon dioxide. These composites offer a dual functionality: firstly, they capture CO2 from direct air, and then they catalyze its conversion into valuable products like carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon. This dual-purpose approach makes Cu MOFs derived composites a pivotal player in addressing the urgent challenge of mitigating CO2 emissions while harnessing its potential for sustainable chemical transformations.

        <p>
            Through the use of a camera, photography is a magnificent art form that freezes moments in time for all time.
            It has the ability to elicit powerful emotions, tell tales, and chronicle the world's beauty and complexity.
            It enables people to communicate their thoughts and feelings through pictures, which aids in my ability to express myself.
            Photography never ceases to amaze, inspire, and educate us, whether it's through capturing the magnificence of nature,
            the intimacy of human relationships, or the essence of a moment.

        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Pranamasana (Prayer Pose):</strong> Pranamasana is the first posture in the yoga sequence. To accomplish this pose, stand upright on your mat and ensure that your feet are placed close to each other. Next, take a deep breath, expand your chest and relax your shoulder. During inhalation, raise your arms from the side and while exhaling join both your palms together as if you are praying. The prayer posture or first salutation is complete.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose):</strong> Ensure that your palms are joined together, just like in the previous prayer pose. Take a deep breath, lift your arms and slightly bend backward. Your biceps must stay close to your ears.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Hasta Padasana (Standing Forward Bend Pose):</strong> Breathe out and bend forward from your waist. Try to touch the floor with your hands. However, ensure that your spine remains straight. While performing this pose, you should exhale slowly and thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Lunge Pose):</strong> Bend your knees slightly, so that the palms can rest on the floor beside your feet. Take a deep breath, bring your right knee towards the right side of your chest and stretch your left leg backward. Raise your head and look forward.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Chaturanga Dandasana (Plank Pose):</strong> Inhale and bring your right leg back as well. Now both your hands will be right under your shoulders. Ensure that your body is parallel to the ground.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Ashtanga Namaskara (Eight Limbed Pose):</strong> This is also referred to as salutations using eight points or parts. After performing Chaturanga Dandasana, exhale and slowly bring your knees down toward the floor. Rest your chin on the floor and keep your hips suspended in the air. If done correctly, both your hands, knees, chin, and chest will rest on the ground while your hips will remain suspended in the air.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose):</strong> Rest your legs and midsection flat on the ground. Position your palms beside your chest. Inhale and apply pressure on the hands to raise your upper body. At this point, your head and torso will resemble a cobra with a raised hood.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose):</strong> Keep your palms and feet where they are. Exhale and gently lift your hips, so that the body forms an inverted âVâ. Straighten your elbows and knees. Look toward your navel.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Ashwa Sanchalanasana (High Lunge Pose):</strong> After performing Adho Mukha Svanasana, go back to Ashwa Sanchalanasana by bringing your right foot forward. Keep your left leg stretched behind you and look forward.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Hasta Padasana (Standing Forward Bend):</strong> Inhale and bring your left foot forward, such that it is next to your right foot. Keeping the position of your hands intact, exhale and slowly bend your torso to enter into the Hasta Padasana pose.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Hasta Uttanasana (Raised Arms Pose):</strong> Inhale and lift your upper body. Join the palms and raise your arms above your head. Then bend backward as you did in step 2.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
            <strong>Pranamasana (Prayer Pose):</strong> This is the last step. Breathe out and stand straight in a relaxed manner. Lower the arms and hold your palms in front of your chest. This marks the end of the first set of Surya Namaskar.

The uranium mined from the earth and used for the production of fuel for nuclear power plants (NPPs) is a depleting resource, while the World Nuclear Association estimates land-based uranium reserves to be around 5.9 million tonnes.<br>
